# First Express Server

This is a single resource API using Express.

## Directions

* Pick a "resource" for your API, like `penguins`
* Implement:
    * `GET /<resource>` - returns array of all of the resources
    * `POST /<resource>` - inserts the supplied request body as a document into the resource collection
    * `GET /<resource>/:id` -
      * returns the single object specified by the id
    * `DELETE /<resource>/:id` - removes the resource with that id
      * **not** an error if doesn't exist.
    * `PUT /<resource>/:id` - updates the resource with supplied request body
* Use plural name in your url path (`/penguins`, **not** `/penguin`)

## Architecture and Design

* Use the **structure** we used in class.
* Follow the **process** we used in class to build up both your model and route

## Testing

* e2e test.

## Rubric

* Each tested API endpoint
  * `GET` all: *2pts*
  * `POST`: *2pts*
  * `GET` by id: *2pts*
  * `PUT` by id: *2pts*
  * `DELETE` by id: *2pts*
